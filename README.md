### Project Title
#### Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project shows the bike usage between three cities **(chicago, new work city and washington)** in US.
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the data inputted by the user, the program will print statistical results such as:
* Most Popular Month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most commonly used start station
* Most commonly used end station
* Most frequent combination combination of start and end stations
* Total travel time
* Mean travel time
* Counts of user types
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* Earliest year of birth (if available)
* Most recent year of birth (if available)
* The most common birth year (if available)
